'That's what I thought.'

---
## Paragraph 8

'Happy to reassure you.'

---
## Paragraph 9

'Boy were you on today. Boy did you ever make that guy look sick. When he hit that one down the line and you got it and fell down and hit that drop-volley Pemulis said the guy looked like he was going to be sick all over the net, he said.'

---
## Paragraph 10

'Boo, I kicked a kid's ass is all. End of story. I don't think it's good to rehash it when I've kicked somebody's ass. It's like a dignity thing. I think we should just let it sort of lie in state, quietly. Speaking of which.'

'You think I think fuzzy thoughts all the time. You let me room with you because you feel sorry for me.'

---
## Paragraph 18

---
## Paragraph 19

'When I asked if you were asleep I was going to ask if you felt like you believed in God, today, out there, when you were so on, making that guy look sick.'

'You ask me this once a week.'

---
## Paragraph 24

'You never say, is why.'

---
## Paragraph 25

'So tonight to shush you how about if I say I have administrative bones to pick with God, Boo. I'll say God seems to have a kind of laid-back management style I'm not crazy about. I'm pretty much anti-death. God looks by all accounts to be pro-death. I'm not seeing how we can get together on this issue, he and I, Boo.'

---
## Paragraph 26

'You're talking about since Himself passed away.' 'See? You never say.' 'I do too say. I just did.'

## Paragraph 29

'There's a difference.'

## Paragraph 32

'How do you feel inside, not?'

---

## Paragraph 38

'Is it a good one?'

---
## Paragraph 39

'Mario, what do you get when you cross an insomniac, an unwilling agnostic, and a dyslexic.'

---
## Paragraph 40

'I give.'

---
## Paragraph 41

'You get somebody who stays up all night torturing himself mentally over the question of whether or not there's a dog.'

---

---
## Paragraph 43

'Shush.'

---

---
## Paragraph 46

'Hey Hal?'

---
## Paragraph 54

'Now she never goes anywhere. Boo. Now she's got the Headmaster's House and her office and the tunnel in between, and never leaves the grounds. She's a worse workaholic than she ever was. And more obsessive-compulsive. When's the last time you saw a dust-mote in that house?'

---
## Paragraph 55

'Hey Hal?'

---
## Paragraph 56

'Now she's just an agoraphobic workaholic and obsessive-compulsive. This strikes you as happification?' 'Her eyes are better. They don't seem as sunk in. They look better. She laughs at C.T. way more than she laughed at Himself. She laughs from lower down inside. She laughs more. Her jokes she tells are better ones than yours, even, now, a lot of the time.'

## Paragraph 57

l l

---
## Paragraph 58

'How come she never got sad?'

---
## Paragraph 59

---
## Paragraph 62

'Hey Hal?'

---
## Paragraph 63

'Don't cry, Booboo. Remember the flag only halfway up the pole? Booboo, there are two ways to lower a flag to half-mast. Are you listening? Because no shit I really have to sleep here in a second. So listen â€” one way to lower the flag to half-mast is just to lower the flag. There's another way though. You can also just raise the pole. You can raise the pole to like twice its original height. You get me? You understand what I mean, Mario?'

---
## Paragraph 64

'Hal?'

---
## Paragraph 65

'She's plenty sad, I bet.'
