## Levels
We want to track things at different levels so that we can use quantitative techniques against the populations:
- Chapters (65)
- Paragraphs (5434)
- Sentences (24943)
- Words ()

So imagine each of those three things as a list of texts - the chapters are 65 separate text-blobs, each of chapter length.  We can then lexify each one of those texts separately, so we have quick access to the individual word counts, etc. (obviously the word-level doesn't need that treatment).

With the more granular views, particularly sentences and words, we have the ability to aggregate up to any arbitrary groups we choose - mixing and matching, so we could divide chapters into artificial constructs like scenes, or we could individually tag sentences that fit some thematic point, or whatever. 

Another possible division layer is a notion that I have called 'fragmentization', which is a separation of spoken dialogue (more properly, things that are 'in quotes'), from pure narration.
