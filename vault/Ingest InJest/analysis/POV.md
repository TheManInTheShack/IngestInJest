This can be thought of as the lens through which we are shown the story.  There's stuff baked into the lens.


I've been thinking today about Ernest P. Worrell, and how we, the audience of the many commercials and the TV show (not so much the movies) are entirely from Vern's point of view - and Vern's reactions are ours by proxy.  This was said in the context of Vern himself being an endlessly patient and forgiving soul...and the fact that our collective viewpoint has its own agency and chooses to react in a certain way to Ernest's antics, puts a moral grounding into the narrative of a Braum's commercial, without being explicit about it.  There's something in that, that relates to this.  I'm sure of it.
