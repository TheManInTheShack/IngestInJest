This thing is the Fox News of Books - decrying what are essentially the same practices it uses.  This can ony be seen in the context of the media that surrounded the book at the approach to it.   Think of how the radio stations overplayed R.E.M.'s 'Radio Song' in spring 1992...either the self-awareness is non-existent, or the shame is.

So also it turns out modern femanist theory rejects a lot of what this says, and while my first guess as a white man was that he just made some skirt-joke that riled up the broads - you know how they are - it actually turns out that this entire field of thought is less one-dimensional than traditional tv and movies and conservative news sources might lead us to believe, and there are other life perspectives that don't tacitly assume the same frame of reference that this work does...its casual assumption of its own background as universal is probably the problem here.  This ... might...have something to do with the point of something or other.  In any case, it's probably worth exploring, just to shut the dames up if nothing else, am I right? :)

** Deconstruction and analysis of IJ helps situate it within the already existing (fractal) cultural framework that it uses to examine the relationship between individuals and culture (esp media).

zooming out.

How do we hold knowledge?  How do we codify history?  What are the actual pieces?  How finely grained can concepts be, and how does language affect the message?  Are there ways that we can model things that are within reach of our own capacity to understand...taking advantage of advanced data structures and modes of storage that allow the kind of 'freedom of movement' of perspective that we would need to do this type of thing.

There's lots of natural-language processing stuff - that's a whole field in itself.  It's how the kids are writing their essays these days, or rather how they are having an AI do so.  We can use some of that to do some of the hard asks, particularly applying part-of-speech tagging and sentiment scoring - crap like that.  What we're concentrating on here though is *narrative*...we want to make it granular, but then build back up into different kinds of pieces.  This gives us an opportunity to look at some of the ways that this sort of thing has been approached.  The most related fields are semiotics, which is about how things mean things, and structuralism, which is about how pieces fit together in stories.  This is especially relevant to a post-modern work like IJ, which seems to be full of narrative tricks and traps.
