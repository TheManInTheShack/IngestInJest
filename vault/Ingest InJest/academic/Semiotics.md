How to do this

The books seem to focus on Saussure/Peirce, and then move chronologically through the structuralism and stuff.   I guess the thing to do is start gathering topics and then organize them, and work through the ones that make sense.

# Dudes
## Plato

## St. Augustine

## Saussure

## Peirce

## Barthes

## Lacan

## Derridas

## Eco


# Model structure
OMG so much of this seems to be like a bunch of academic language for chapter upon chapter, going through a lot of philosophical justification, to reach the mind-numbingly obvious conclusion that we should put this shit into a graph.  I could have told them that for free.
